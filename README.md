 Deep Neural Networks for Regression problems


Neural networks are well known for classification problems, for example, they are used in handwritten digits classification, but the question is will it be fruitful if we used them for regression problems?

In this article I will use a deep neural network to predict house pricing using a dataset from KaggleÂ .

You can download the dataset from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)


## Contents :
    1- Process the dataset
    2- Make the deep neural network
    3- Train the DNN
    4- Test the DNN
    5- Compare the result from the DNN to another ML algorithm
